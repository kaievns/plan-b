# Plan B

This is a tiny opinionated PCB that has everything packed in one place for
creating split bluetooth keyboards on top of nrf52840 chip and ZMK firmware

Think about it as

- an improved nice!nano clone in a smaller package
- has baked nice!view inside with a slot for LCD
- has baked in RGB controller
- has baked in 6-pin SPI interface for external sensor
- has baked in wiring for 6x5 keyboard matrix via JST connectors
- has baked in power/reset switches for both sides

All in a tiny 14x42mm package, which is about 8m longer than nice!view shield
